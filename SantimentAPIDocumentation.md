Santiment API Documentation

Overview: 
  The Santiment API fetches the market data(Price, Marketcap,Volume) of the desired cryptocurrencies. 
  Here I have used Bitcoin, Solana & Ethereum.

Base URL: 
  "https://api.santiment.net/graphql";
  
Authentication:
  No authentication is required from the end-user calling your /api/market endpoint. Your server acts as a middleman that handles the authentication part privately.
